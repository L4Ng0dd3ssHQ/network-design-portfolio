# 🌐 Network Design Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer projects built during my journey to become a network engineer.  
Each project demonstrates core networking concepts such as VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, OSPF, NAT, DHCP, and secure remote management (SSH and ACLs).
